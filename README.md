## About

ArgBase (argbase.org) is a knowledge platform designed to streamline access to established arguments and evidence. Our mission is to reduce the cognitive overhead of repeatedly reconstructing accepted truths in discussions and debates.

## Problem

In today's information landscape, we often find ourselves:
- Repeatedly explaining the same concepts from scratch
- Spending time gathering evidence for well-established facts
- Losing valuable discussion time to rebuilding foundational arguments
- Missing opportunities for deeper discourse due to time spent on basics

## Solution

ArgBase serves as a centralized repository of structured arguments, evidence, and conclusions. It provides:

- **Argument Mapping**: Clear visualization of logical relationships between claims
- **Evidence Library**: Curated collection of sources supporting established facts
- **Quick Reference**: Easily accessible summaries of common arguments
- **Citation System**: Direct links to specific points and their supporting evidence
- **Search Functionality**: Intelligent query system to find relevant arguments and counter-arguments

## Core Features

- üîç Smart search with natural language processing
- üìö Hierarchical organization of arguments
- üîó Cross-referencing between related topics
- üìä Strength indicators for evidence and arguments
- ü§ù Community contribution system
- üì± Mobile-friendly interface
