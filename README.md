## About

ArgBase (argbase.org) is a knowledge platform designed to streamline access to established arguments and evidence. Our mission is to reduce the cognitive overhead of repeatedly reconstructing accepted truths in discussions and debates.

## Problem

In today's information landscape, we often find ourselves:
- Repeatedly explaining the same concepts from scratch
- Spending time gathering evidence for well-established facts
- Losing valuable discussion time to rebuilding foundational arguments
- Missing opportunities for deeper discourse due to time spent on basics

## Solution

ArgBase serves as a centralized repository of structured arguments, evidence, and conclusions. It provides:

- **Argument Mapping**: Clear visualization of logical relationships between claims
- **Evidence Library**: Curated collection of sources supporting established facts
- **Quick Reference**: Easily accessible summaries of common arguments
- **Citation System**: Direct links to specific points and their supporting evidence
- **Search Functionality**: Intelligent query system to find relevant arguments and counter-arguments

## Core Features

- 🔍 Smart search with natural language processing
- 📚 Hierarchical organization of arguments
- 🔗 Cross-referencing between related topics
- 📊 Strength indicators for evidence and arguments
- 🤝 Community contribution system
- 📱 Mobile-friendly interface

## Technology Stack

- React
- Node.js
- TailwindCSS
- React Router
- Firebase (Auth + Firestore)

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev           # Start dev server at http://localhost:5173
npm run build         # Build for production
npm run preview       # Preview production build
npm test              # Run unit tests in watch mode
npm run test:ci       # Run unit tests once (CI mode)
npm run lint          # Run ESLint
npm run lint:fix      # Auto-fix ESLint issues
npm run check         # Full validation: test → lint → build
npm run harden        # Pre-deploy security checks
npm run deploy        # Deploy to staging (auto on push to main)
